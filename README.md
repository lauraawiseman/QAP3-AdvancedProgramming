# Project Overview

#### This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java, focusing on interfaces, abstraction, and polymorphism. It defines a Scalable interface that allows different shapes to be scaled dynamically while maintaining their properties.

## Features
- Implements an interface (Scalable) to scale shapes
- Uses abstract classes (Shape) for a common structure
- Defines multiple shape classes: Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, and EquilateralTriangle
- Validates triangle inequality for valid triangle creation
- Implements a scaling function that modifies object dimensions

## How to Run the Project

1. Compile all Java files (if using terminal)
2. Run the Demo file (numbered by problem)
